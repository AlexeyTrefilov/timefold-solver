A fast, easy-to-use, open source AI constraint solver for software developers

== Looking for Quickstarts?

Timefold's quickstarts are located in the https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-quickstarts[timefold-quickstarts repository].

== Quick development start

To build and run from source:

----
$ mvn clean install -Dquickly
$ cd timefold-solver-examples
$ mvn exec:java
----

To develop with IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or VSCode, open the root `pom.xml` as a new project
and configure a _Run/Debug configuration_ like this:

* Type: Application
* Main class: `ai.timefold.solver.examples.app.TimefoldExamplesApp`
* VM options: `-Xmx2G -server` (memory only needed when using the big datasets in the examples)
* Program arguments: (none)
* Working directory: `$MODULE_DIR$` (must resolve to timefold-solver-examples directory)
* Use classpath of module: `timefold-solver-examples`

== Contributing to Timefold

This is an open source project, and you are more than welcome to contribute :heart:!


* If you're just starting out with Timefold and want to contribute,
take a look at our https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20PLANNER%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20Reopened)%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20starter%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC[starter issues].
They're specifically chosen to be easier for first time contributors.

* If you want to contribute or start an opinionated discussion, join our https://groups.google.com/g/timefold-solver-dev[discussion] or send an e-mail directly to timefold-solver-dev@googlegroups.com.

* If you want to submit an issue, check out the https://issues.redhat.com/projects/PLANNER/issues[Timefold Jira project].

=== Time to make a change?

Every change must be submitted through a GitHub pull request (PR). Timefold uses continuous integration (CI). The Timefold CI  runs checks against your branch after you submit the PR to ensure that your PR doesn't introduce errors. If the CI identifies a potential problem, our friendly PR maintainers will help you resolve it.

=== Contributing

. Fork it (https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver).
. Create your feature branch: (`git checkout -b feature`).
. Commit your changes with a comment: (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
. Push to the branch to GitHub: (`git push origin feature`).
. Create a new pull request.

=== Code standards

Your code is automatically formatted according to the _Import and Code Style_ conventions during every Maven build. CI checks enforce those conventions too, so be sure to build your project with maven before creating your PR:
----
mvn clean install
----
For information about how to set up code style checks, see https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-solver/blob/main/build/timefold-solver-ide-config/ide-configuration.adoc[IDE Setup Instructions].

=== Building your Timefold project

Use one of the following ways to build your Timefold project:

- :rocket: *build-fast*: `mvn clean install -Dquickly` skips any checks and code analysis (~1 min)

- :hammer: *build-normally*: `mvn clean install` runs tests, checks code style, skips documentation  (~17 min)

- :receipt: *build-doc*: `mvn clean install` at `timefold/timefold-solver-docs` creates asciidoctor documentation `target/timefold-solver-docs-*/html_single/index.html` (~2 min)

- :mechanical_arm: *build-all*: `mvn clean install -Dfull` runs all checks + creates documentation and distribution files (~20 min)

== Timefold CI status

You can check the CI status of the Timefold repositories from the https://kiegroup.github.io/timefold/[Chain Status webpage].
